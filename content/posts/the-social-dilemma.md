A compilation of texts I sent to my friends while watching it (on 2x or 2.5x speed of course (I forgot))

Watched 2/3rds of social dilemma.
It is sad this is not common knowledge.
I see why it is recommended so often, but personally the only thing that was interesting is the graph they showed of processor ability increasing exponentially, it accounted for time.
Sometimes, it surprises how much people don't know.

Also the comparison that there aren't engineers split testing 60000 colours to get you to use the photoshop more puts in perspective that social media can be non-addictive, more tool-like. This is an opportunity for open source.

Useful mental model: A tool will sit there until you use it. It won't pull you towards it (notifications).

Thank fuck they're like economic incentives drive this. The narrative that Zuck, or Elon are evil is so rampant in the OSS world. It is surprising how people that advocate independence and privacy fall for an emotional argument.

It's just money bro, they don't set out to ruin the world.

Action: Don't use social media. Leave whatsapp groups - they enable positive random enforcement.Disable notifications. I may move to Signal when moving to NZ, a fresh slate.

Avoid using phone - keep it powered off. Or airplane mode so alarms work.

No internet at home in NZ? Either way I won't be able to afford mobile data for a bit. Jio has spoiled me and my fellow Indians, but I'm grateful for it. The internet raised me,and Iam so glad it did.
