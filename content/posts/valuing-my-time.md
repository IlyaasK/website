I have been recently trying to value my time more, in terms of spending money to save time. However, I have little income right now. The actual value of my hour must be somewhere around Rs 200 an hour if we went according to my Jersey Business, however, it is a niche product, and demand is not enough to justify traveling expenses despite then saving time.

S right now, I am focusing on optimizing for minimal time wasted. On bullshit. Social media, YouTube, bullshit tasks, etc. Commuting. Commuting has been a big one. I don't go to school right now because of the Diwali break and it saves so much time. When I do have to go to school, I ride so that comes in as training time. Additionally, I use it as diffused thinking time, so half of the time, I am holding my phone to my mouth to voice record my ideas, and I am riding hands-free. I love that I have that habit now and that I am over time, turning into a creator rather than a consumer. So many ideas and voice notes.

One more predicament is WhatsApp.
There is just so much bullshit on WhatsApp, from school groups to MTB groups to friend groups. Most of the texts are noise, but I will stay for the important ones, mainly because they will be useful - school stuff is useful communication - updates. I will have to sell my MTB when I leave, so I will need the groups then. Friend groups are used to plan meetups.

My solution to this is once I have exhausted their usefulness, which will be once I sell my MTB - that is the last useful thing on WhatsApp, I will delete it and switch to Signal. People who matter - the ones I want to text regularly, will switch to Signal. In fact, only one person is remaining to switch to Signal. I will ask them to once I delete Whatsapp. Having them switch to Signal will be no issue. Apart from that friend I don't mind not being able to contact others. They will switch to Signal if I matter.

I may have to get back on WhatsApp there to connect with people. I will try Signal only. In case I have to be back, no BS WhatsApp groups anymore.  Only Signal. I don't mind Discord - it is great for video calling, something I plan to do a lot of.
