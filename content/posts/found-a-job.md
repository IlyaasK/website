My Business Communication just penalized us for using ChatGPT.

I'll laugh in 5 years when they realize it's like asking students not to use Google. This is ridiculous.

The academic world and the business world are actually so different :).

Back to me. [I woke up at 5 AM](https://ilyaas.netlify.app/posts/progress-and-realisations/) for only 1/5 days. I think this is a result of my sleeping late, which is a consequence of time-wasting.

I have lost my ability to [sit still as I eat or to be bored in general](https://ilyaas.netlify.app/posts/silence/). I developed this ability at the start of this year when I lost my phone. I may need to simulate that again.

[Piyush](https://www.treadmark.co.nz/) has made me go back to the Transition line to correct my technique.

I am riding the bike more now, becoming a part of the bike rather than being a slave to its movement.

I am pushing more into the lip and letting it do the work, rather than exploding and pulling too hard, ending up as a dead sailor in the air.

Piyush also put me in contact with Shauna from [Remarkable People](https://www.remarkablepeople.co.nz/), where I am getting a job for 24.5 NZD, pre-tax, or 19.6 post-tax, as a general worker in a casual role. I get to choose the shifts I please.

I will likely work 80 hours in the next 3 weeks to pay for my [PMBIA level 1 certification](https://pmbia.org/courses/pmbia-courses/pmbia-level-1-course) and some other MTB protection that totals around 1500 NZD or so.
I realized that I could work during my scheduled breaks. But now that I potentially have an income source, I need to employ more discipline to cut back on unnecessary desires. I want to maximize my bike time and not get caught up in the rat race of working more hours for more money to then manage a less fulfilling life. I want to work just enough to sustain my MTB and nothing more. I do not want to work to make money and outsource parts of my life. Time is more valuable than money. I need time to ride and edit my MTB videos.

Also, my current schedule leaves little time for studying for exams, which means I am just barely passing. This may prove problematic if I want to further my studies, and [possibly finish and get a degree at ICMS Australia](https://www.qrc.ac.nz/degree-pathways/). But I am done preparing for contingencies, always putting other stuff first because MTB might not work out, and prioritizing other work or studying so I can get to places where I can improve my MTB skills. I'd rather get there based on my MTB skills like [Piyush did with the British Downhill Series](https://www.google.com/search?q=british%20downhill%20series%20piyush%20chavamn&sca_esv=563563987). I may email and set an appointment with an immigration agency when I have extra cash to figure out if I can get a skilled migrant visa or if I have to have an AEWV visa.

My sister may have a lethal illness, and I don't seem to be emotionally affected. If she were to die tomorrow, it would not impact my life, other than the occasional Google Photos memory. It's interesting how I seem to turn off my emotions often; being emotion-free seems to be my default state.

It's also like most things I read are now mental masturbation because [I could have been taking action](https://ilyaas.netlify.app/posts/produce/) instead of reading that particular thing.

I'm glad I can learn from Piyush, who, every 2/3 days, gives me a mini coaching lesson for 15 minutes and provides feedback as he watches me ride. But I have to be aware that I do not want to have his life. His knowledge and contacts are of great value, but his mindset and way of life are not. Piyush's circle, people, and life are not the end-all-be-all; I want to use them as a springboard to greater heights.

Video calling Kashish reminded me why I don't speak to him anymore - because of his lack of direction and inaction. He is genuinely happy for me, and I appreciate him for that. I will help him as much as I can, but I will not spend a lot of time with him because I do not want to fall to his level.

It is also interesting as I integrate more here and get more familiar with people. I no longer feel like an outsider or that people around me are outside my tribe. This has resulted in physical attraction, something I have become very skilled at ignoring because emotional attraction does not exist, and there is no opportunity to build it.
