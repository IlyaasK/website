Welcome back to ilyaas at the shitter.

So I want to date this girl. I've liked her on and off for a long time now.

I don't like her right now, but mainly because I don't allow myself to. I can easily. Either, I've gotten to the point where I'm used to the feeling, or it has faded.

Let me rephrase. I like her. I am not infatuated with her. Everything is not rosy because I like her. I like her in the most  "She'd be a good partner" typa way. I have been infatuated with her, but that ended soon after I asked her out and she said no.

She is my one-itis. I have asked her out and she has declined. We've maintained our friendship. We're really close friends.

I still want to date her. I'd be happy to do so due to the emotional connection we have, due to our conversations - the amount of unfiltered the both of us get. Also, she pretty.

Now let me be clear, I am well aware of her flaws. And the possible frictions that would arise when we date. I do put her on a pedestal. They're something she's working on. In addition, we'll work on them when we're dating.

And it's not that I obsess over her 24/7. I am open to dating others, as long as they meet my (extremely) high standards, as long as there is potential for a long-term relationship; To put it bluntly, if she has the potential to be the mother of my children. I have insane ambitions and little time to waste.

Now, she has declined in the past. She was also not single. She is now. She knows that I look forward to dating her and that dating her is now part of my ambition.

For some time I thought she was quite masculine, especially because of her work and competence.

For those who are unaware

A masculine person is one who focuses on their work, their mission, and search for freedom, above all else. A feminine person is one who values love and feeling it above all else. This is according to [The Way Of The Superior Man](https://3lib.net/book/2883297/a6a90f) by David Deida

But I've seen her with her ex. Let's just say, she can be VERY feminine, and that is incredibly attractive.

Here is my predicament:
There are some standards she does not meet. There are some things I'm iffy about. I still want to date her. I wouldn't want to date her if I'd met her recently. So do I truly like her for her? or because she rejected me and there is ambition there, merely a "trophy'?

No, I think I know.

As I typed this I realized that I AM open to dating others. I'd be open to dating her as well. It's just the then depth of the emotional connection would be difficult to develop in a short time. But I think the emotional connection makes up for it. They're things we can openly talk about. The both of us can discuss my concerns before committing long-term.

I'll make sure of it. I know myself. I am not very worried about making the wrong decision here. I journal way too much to do so. Both of us speak the raw truth way too much.

And the worst-case scenario is that I date her, and realize that there isn't long-term potential there. Or I get to NZ and realize that there are others that I'd like to date instead.

It's [1stman's male advantage in my head](https://3lib.net/book/18328342/4bd1b6) as well. As I level up, I will have access to better and better women. So a rational man would eventually have to call it quits because of the quality of women available after a year or 2 or further self-improvement.

I know the both of us will speak about it and come to a conclusion before we commit.

Oh also, in case you're reading this:

Good evening m'lady

Good day to you (the reader) as well bro.

Now, I just have to become man enough to incite her femininity. To be a viable sexual partner. It is all on me. That drives me. It really does.

Fuck, I did not intend on writing this when I sat on the shitter, but here we are. I hope you're having a lovely time.

*flying kisses*
