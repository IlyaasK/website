Constraints theoruy - a system will only grow until it's is allowed. It is bottlenecked by its weakest link. Attack the constraints - for me MTB wise, this is riding and not fitness. For YT and media - it is volume

2 common constraints:

1. "I am ... high enxiety/neurotic/all or nothing"

Does that belief serve you. something I am implementing> Believe it then make it come true. I will be the GOAT then work towards it. I will date my ideal woman, then make it happen. Don't worry about historical accuracy, choose beliefs that serve you and then make them come true.

Inorder to grow, your identity must be whatever is required to grow. Period. Otherwise you don't.

I have a tendency is still better.

"will saying this help me accomplish the goals that I have?" If not, then stop saying it.

2. Crutches and superstition is dangerous. By extension routines are as well. For me this is food. I am so concerned with eating right that I sacrifice MTB trip - the thing I eat right for,while knowing riding skill is my constraint, not fitness.

Becoming dependent on a routine makes you weaker - Why hamza was a jeffrey in Thailand, why Vihaan and I find it difficult to be productive if we begin the day wrong.

"I have to". "I must", "I need to"

people did not have blue light blocking glasses, they did just fine - they did not produce at my rate either. I understand how my phone is a crutch, and I am working on eliminating it. My Night routine and journalling for example, is a "crutch" I am okay keeping.

is journalling my new default now? do I feel shittier without it. Yes, but I feel like that is because I have reacher a better, more present new normal. But I don't how to test that theory.
