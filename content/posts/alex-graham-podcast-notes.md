meaning captivity book

shared goals
shared value
respect for each other

we're in it together vs cheerleader and quarterback

when you say I want to be happy you say there is a defecit between your current reality and happiness which will always remain outside of yourself

defecits occur when we speak desires

desire is a contract we make with ourselves to be happy with what we want

Why do you need to be happy, why do you need meaning? Why do you want Roof?

that is creating an expectation of life whereas, if that is not done, life is just is - pure acceptance

i do this period - the goals have to disappear - no extrinsic motivation

you just are - don't think about it

worthiness doesn't matter - liberation in meaninglessness - like I do - no one is watching/reading so I can post whatever I want

garyvee - I'm gonna die and nothing matters

why should we process trauma? We choose our trauma - adler psychology - only perspective matters how you chose to get over B

We question our beliefs except the one we truly believe. Those we never question

greater leverage - lower marginal cost - you want goods to be non rival

2nd pod:

convergent thinking vs divergent thinking - one answer vs multiple correct answers. We need divergent thinking

I don't want to be the product for news. Their intention is not to educate me

Anti-information diet. No phone at home. Change your number often? Don't consume - Eliminate it. Figure out desktop versions of social media. No consume meaning no following. Goal: get valuable enough to have someone else (Executive assistant) plan out your days out.

Airplane - get 2 aisle seats to be next to each other.

Systemize your decision making. Then outsource a my micro-decisions. All of this to focus on the highest leverage vehicles.

Have a go-to-bed alarm, not a wake-up alarm.

Deep work start to the day. for like 8 hours. Then shallow work, then train, and then sleep

when most people do something - oh that is a great path to mediocrity
