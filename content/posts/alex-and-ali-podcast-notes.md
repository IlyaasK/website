100K - just sell something to someone
1M - 100K but consistent - over time
1 - 3M - increase output of that main thing (more videos) and build the core team

product market fit means someone wants your product - your are satisfying a need

business is when you are employing other people

personal interest mein find specific knowledge - MTB, linux, SI, productivity, studying, Islam?

start, business can be changed later

service businesses less risky

to start, do what others are doing - fix their holes - do it better - start a business for education instead of income

solve a specific problem and money will flow

if you are good at something and people ask you about it -  for me video, writing, tech, mtb/fitness, it is an indication of things you can charge for later

make service free for first 10 clients or for charity to collect testimonials. transition from free service to paid service. If they don't want to pay you: you suck or they suck or ask them for referrals

gain employment to learn - offer to work for free and pay down ignorance debt as fast as possible

'it is costing me a billion dollars a year not knowing how to make a billion dollars a year'

fuck the S&P 500. invest in SME 500. e for education

the rick and wealthy can earn - they don't save their way to riches (MJ Demarco echoes)

FUCK FUCK  FUCK

$200K student loan -  but $4000/month rental property- that is it game over. A guy he knows did this

is there a better return on education elsewhere? do that. book and mastermind - on selling, ads, making courses, etc.

when investing - take the 4% inflation into account. Inflation adjusted returns are not very fun

idea: 2 day certification - $500 - draw blood person - lobotomist - earning capacity - $7 (minimum wage) to $25 an hour.
work 8 weeks - get cert - 3x income
borrow money from parents - pay next week with earning - 7 weeks saved
OR
invest $500 in the S&P 500 - $2.5/year

INSANE - income explosion is first priority. You have an income problem

risk mitigation for business - strip at night and drive ubers - $150k  a year
If you learn to sell - sell cars, make $400K a year

back to the girl - lobotomist - 50k a year - live with parents - 30 k  a year - any sub 10M/year skill can be learned for under $30,000

4AM to PM apprentice, then train - have this work ethic

go to  a small business to learn the whole thing, in  big corporate firsm you are a small cog and won't learn overall business

long pre-sale to collect cash when you're launching a product

challenge - $300 charge - if you don't lose 20 punds in 6 weeks - your money back - you can do this for speed as MTB coach.
then once they hit it - you have this good habit, why stop when you have momentum - I'll  deduct 300 off your yearly membership. Boom. Sale. How do I translate this to MTB?

hook them with specific outcome in specific timeline - charge 3-4x more on a onetime expense than a recurring basis that allows you to pay fixed costs easily.

you can learn everything on youtube, what you pay for in a course is speed/time saving. "It's america, everyone sells their time. Just tell me what the price is"

"I don't want to learn ads, I want to learn how he would think through running my ads".
this also increases baseline

maeke gym ads - 20K a mont
make gym ads and get customers - 100K a month

skills multiply

"I would die before I let my father have a I told you so moment"

When you hate your job - I will die to him (boss) or die to myself

He moved halfway across the country to tell his father, and I am moving halfway across the world to pursue my shit. Fucking hell. Makes me smile.

If you're so good at gyms you should be selling how to fill up gyms, not filling them up - Hamza can do this, Ali Abdaal and Captain Sinbad are already doing this.

One consistent theme is that he goes to masterminds and workshops to learn

turn key - he would get gyms customers, collect all the money from his program. give them the recurring revenue

wealth ladder:
don't have to worry about basic needs
don't have to worry about discretionary spending
luxury wealth - 100K a month

alex spends a lot of money on information

behenchod - $350K an hour to learn from an expert

he live on 10% of what he makes max, prolly 5%

value time - you spent more money sitting here than what the dinner cost - stop splitting money during dinners

goal: "while we have waited in line, I have made more money than what this lunch costs, let me cover lunch, I don't care"

he carries a lot of cash so he can go on offence whenever he wants to - does not care about money losing value - I already make a ton of money, what will I get the return for?

if he didn't have leila, he would invest in dividend ETFs - appreciate and dividend, make it a game to make the dividend cheques as high as possible. This is my goal. A power couple. A woman made from steel. Partners.

media ROI - cost a dollar a year per subscriber and he makes more in just adsense - so ROI is insane

dude, this guy is mega capitalist - buy an accounting firm to provide accounting to his entire portfolio of companies at cost.

his goal is to get to 10 billion. I need to watch more of this guy. mission is to make real business knowledge available for everyone

why do that?
"it set me free." I want to become like this guy, massive buff, beard, money, and a boss ass partner - his demeanor is attractive as well

no kids rn but he has the options to have kids and that is what matters. Michael Jordan deal - business is what makes him wake up in the morning. Fuck me as well. I wake up at 6, despite wanting to sleep, MTB wins. MTB WINS BRO . Let me repeat that, MTB WINS AGAINST SLEEP do you realize how significant that is. He wants to bring his all for every program because it is the only program someone attends and is hoping to change their life and he wants to honor that.

5am to 1pm is alex time to do Alex work - read: Deep Work
1 to 4:30 PM is meetings time
go to the gym, eat then day is over

This fucking asshole does deep work for 8 hours

"just start and the path illuminates as you walk"

"you can cover a hell of a lot in 60 seconds if you know what you're saying"

playbook:
hire the best vendor - pay whatever
hire an inhouse person to interface between you and them
double the volume
when inhouse vendor starts doing more than outside, fire them

garyvee model - all platforms, as big as possible, as much content as possible

phases of plan:
start YT
get on all platforms - he is here now
maximize all platforms
bring all of it in house
run paid ads
affiliates/addons
more showishcontent

Big dick statement/world view - "I believe, because our belief shapes our world, you can make content for the beginner as well as the advanced"
ex. make sales persuasion now eveyone will watch

he chooses beliefs - he chooses to believe he can go deep and wide, and then works to make his belief accurate.  Think: Does that belief serve you?"

Ali: "if you could start the content thing again, what would you do different----"
Alex: "would've started  5 years ago." fuck instant answer. I need to start asap. Schedule videos kal.

has had 6 pack abs since the age of 16

lack of knowledge or motivation for 6 pack abs? motivation

then he justs lets it go. fuck, he just lets it go - that's okay - "if you don't want it enough, it doesn't matter, then it's just accepting you don't want to pay the price and therefore won't get it. "fuck. what a big dick energy dude - ultimate outcome independence

the issue is not a knowledge gap, it is an accountability gap, with gyms and personal coaching

"hack short term pain for long term gain, and you hack success"

do you even want a six pack - it is unpacking your reasons and stories justifying that reasons, that is it

he will live a shorter life because of how much muscle mass he carries. long live - eat less and walk

"figure out what you want, find out what the price is, and pay that price"

to get a six pack, or any such pursuit - it costs one dollar out of 16 waking dollars - is it worth it? It is a big price. Depends on what you are solving for.

What are you solving for Ilyaas?
Right now, getting to NZ and padhai. Post 6 march, YT and MTB. Meanwhile, I am also solving for a better man, partner social skills and personality wise. I am solving for being the man Roof deserves/pines for.

passive income body - your body has spent a lot of resources creating the muscle, so it wants so to keep it. Just give it stimulation on a weekly basis, eat enough calories and protein.
