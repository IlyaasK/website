Goal for this week:

Wake at 5AM every day - I have been back to waking at 7. I want to wake at 5 for the following week and will keep it that way, instead of waking at 4, for recovery purposes.

Finish Mini Dream - The inside small line. I am confident that I can do 2 more jumps and change one jump line to a bigger one, but including the weekend, I should finish mini dream small line this week, and move on to the bigger line next week.

Finish InfoTech Ad And Niche Market Presentation - These are less goals, more things to get done, so I can move on to editing my last Indian rides.

Brush twice a day every day - There is a cavity developing around my wisdom tooth, which is getting loose, and I do not want it to continue.

Life update:

It is becoming summer, so I am wearing fewer layers, and sunlight is extending longer. I will keep MTB first and let editing go until I get a job, at which point I will do more editing, because I won't have to do homework, and/or outsource editing.

In the last 2 days, I did 3 jumps of Mini Dream. This is up from practicing the transition line for 2 weeks straight. Exponential progress. Thanks to [Piyush](https://www.treadmark.co.nz/), I am getting the technique dialed, which feels like a cheat code, I have unlocked every jump on Mini Dream, I just have to have the balls and familiarity/ speed judgment to do them. 

Having Piyush give feedback is like trying to form sentences with words, instead of letters. It becomes about stringing techniques together, instead of trying to figure out what the technique is or what to do in the first place. I am grateful.

I am grateful to be around much better jumpers, and soon when the Skyline bike park opens in 3 weeks, much faster riders. I observe them and then get towed in by them, which makes my progress so much faster. Today I was towed in by a grandfather, with a 10-year-old retro ass bike with an external air chamber for the shock :). Absolute legend. I also found a dude called Logan. He is 13, but fast. Something about him makes me like him.

I also realized that I can summarise the difference between JBCN and QRC as: JBCN instills an [owner's mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6rqAw3D03M) and QRC instills an employee's mindset. Less agency, more rule-following.

As for the people, JBCN kids were driving for something. Here many more are NPCs - partying, having fun, that sort of thing. Makes me appreciate my Indian friends a lot more. But that is likely an outcome of my course, which tends to attract a certain kind of 'chill' person. I, of course, am using this as my ticket to a Western country. That may have proved an unwise decision, due to the lack of an open post-study work visa, but let's see what I'll make of it.

Today I spoke to Zulf, who asked me if I was hitting on any girls. Piyush asked me 'chhorri ko pataya' as well. This is likely due to my lack of enthusiasm or interaction in class, but I haven't found a chick with a similar lifestyle and ambition. I have not found the whole package - there are gym girls, but I know for a fact that they don't read. I am using that as a proxy for intelligence/hunger for improvement or great professional aspirations. I am not worried, because I've set up my life that way. I probably do not come off as ambitious or extraordinary to them either. A chick has shown interest, but I've ignored it. There are bigger fish to fry. Overall it makes me more grateful for Roof, for showing what was possible, both in terms of emotions and person quality. However that brings its own issues of comparison and sometimes, longing. But as I work on it, it reduces.

Yakheem, if that is his spelling, complimented me on my rate of progress. If Piyush continues to teach me techniques, I think it is only a matter of time before I start winning races. because I will do the volume necessary to get there. And, to my surprise, I am willing to sacrifice YouTube for it as well.

I am reading more as well. But again, it is mental masturbation. There are other books I should read that will be more helpful. I also realised that for some things, like parenting, looking at the data is useless, because I and my children will not have the life circumstances of most, for I will change them.

I also realized that I will expect my wife to become a full-time mother, despite her ambitions. I will also be a full-time father, despite my ambitions, because as long as I fit my wife, children, and work in the day - considering 4h for each, that is a good day. A lack of social life may be a common theme in my life.

People are surprised by the fact that I don't have friends, but I have been this way for quite a while. I don't 'hang out'. We study/ride together. Sometimes we sort emotions out together, but I've never been one for just timepass, except for Boisar. Even with Vihaan and Arya - there has been studying and editing/studying respectively.

I find [Modern Wisdom By Chris Williamson](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisWillx) informative.

This blog may have been mimetic desire because [Siddha](https://substack.com/@siddhasalunkhe) and [Vivek](https://aspiringlawyersrecord.substack.com/) are blogging, but this one has been inspired by [Siddha's blog post](https://siddhasalunkhe.substack.com/p/goals-for-the-coming-week]), and it has been good to dump shit on paper. Clears brain space.
