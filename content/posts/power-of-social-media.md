A mutual acquaintance reached out to me. I now have a 700-page custom pdf of philosophical works and a friend who resonates with what I write and who enjoys reading - more sophisticated texts yet in the same domain as I do. This is what I'd call a high-value relationship. The fucking power of the globalized world we live in. Opportunities are everywhere. Use social media to produce, not consume. Deliver value. I love this.
