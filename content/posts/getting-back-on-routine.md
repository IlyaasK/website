It is 11pm as I write this. I have been unable to sleep early for the past week. I went to Pashan last week and slept in the car 12, hit the bed at 5am and woke up at 12pm. I have been waking and sleeping late for the rest of the week. This is bullshit.

I need to get tired during the day. Tomorrow, I will wake up at 7:30 and straight go for a ride.No breakfast. One run. Flow trail to temple trail, to get myself tired so I can sleep early.

I also binge on reading/youtube at night. This has become a problem. Two solutions. I will see how riding impacts this. I reckon riding in the morning will be enough pleasure for me to not binge at night. If that does not work, I will go back to old routine where I do deep school work for 3 hours, shallow work for 1, write for 90 mins and read for 90 mins. Right now, I just do school work the whole day. I don't write. I feel like that is me making my day a prison, so I want to extend my waking hours at night for some dopamine. Yeah.

Essentially, I need to get back on routine. I will kal. Do both.

I am doing school work the whole day because I have A2 exams in 2.5 months and I was doing AS up until now - retests. I should be done with Accounting syllabus by the end of next week. Then I have 2 months for 2 subjects syllabus and all subjects revision/past papers. This is going to be a grind. Since my current method does not seem to be effective, I will switch back to my more effective old one.

I will blog kal (tomorrow) or parso (day after) and let you know how it works.
