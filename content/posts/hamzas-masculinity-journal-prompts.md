## What stage of the Maslow's hierarchy of needs do I need to fulfill?
Love/Sex/Romance, I believe.

## Who is in my tribe?
Immediate tribe - Mother, siblings, Arya, Vihaan, ROok/SO.
Inner - JBCN brotherhood, MTB bros
Outer - SI people, other MTBers - global youtube audience

## What is some work I can do that will help my tribe?
Share what I've learnt:
Youtube and blog.
Document my journey to greatness - help future generations learn.

## What do I want my life to be like in 10 years time?
I want to have a trad wife, who I am building an empire with.

I am at the top of Downhill MTB. SO travels with me to the races. I have a chef, a mas sues, physiotherapist, a cook, a gym, a personal trainer, a therapist that travel with me.

I have retired my SO. I have retired my family. SO works on her projects out of pure interest. The only man she submits to is me. The main thing she works in is our business. My manager, in a way, almost.

I am the GOAT. I have well surpassed the 32 or so wins required. I have leveraged my position as the GOAT and the income have my own media agency/content machine. I earn double of my MTB stuff from that. MTB brings $2m a year. Media brings $2m a year in profit.

I have published a book on how to go pro - how to become a professional mountain biker.

I create content related to Self improvement, efficiency, MTB and athleticism on YouTube.

Multiple citizenships, due to marriage.

I am 80kg lean - 10% BF. I lift 2x body-weight squats, dead-lifts. My bench is 1.5x and shoulder press is 1x.

Arya and I meet for a week and make an edit every year, in the off season. Whenever he is free - he makes too many Hollywood films.

I have 1m youtube subs. My blog get 100K weekly views.

My book has sold a million copies.

I wake up early and train 3x a day. I do deep work in the middle. 2h session 3x a day. SO and I go on weekly dates on my rest days (in the morning of course).

I have a sleep coach.

What is another sacrifice I can make to make more progress towards my goals?

Wake up early and sleep early - switch off my phone by 6:30 pm and sleep by 8.
This will increase my deep work hours, while keeping my sleep in check AND daily MTB rides. A keystone habit.
