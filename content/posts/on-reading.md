A cheat code to life.

[As Louis Rossman explained](https://piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=Y9ZzRTj-GGs):

What if using calculators was allowed in exams?
What is using textbooks was allowed in exams?

Someone has solved a problem you're having, and has written a book about it. You figure out what is took that person 30 to 300 hours to learn for $10 in books and 4 hours of reading. Insane ROI.

I am the black sheep in my family because books expanded my perspective. My friend Satish who is also the black sheep in his family, concurs.

Reading is the vehicle through which you can solve all your problems.
