Your thoughts are your philosophy for life. They form the basis of your actions. Your actions are the basis for your life. This is why they matter.

## Video 1: Theory Of Constraints

In oneâ€™s life, a bottleneck exists, one of three things that are constricting their growth, becoming a bottleneck:

- Skills
- Traits
- Beliefs

Traits and beliefs are both trainable. Everything on that list can be controlled.

For me, a limiting belief was, "I may not be rich before finishing college."

Hamza says that most people's current constraint is either a belief or trait. Another word for belief is mindset.

## Video 2: Work All Day

You will not make money doing nothing. Value must be provided.

All income is active; the question is, "how active is it?"

Hamza lived a life where he only had to work 4 hours a week. It was depressing. Anyone on school vacation with nothing to do will relate to this. Hard work is fulfilling.

What can you do all day? Do that. Make that your active income.

Active income is the way to go. Working for active income forms the 'good old days'.

## Video 3: Change Your Identity

You must become someone new to succeed.

Change your identity. This works. I became the 'social guy'. This made it easy to be social at school. I was identified as such as well. Positive flywheel.

One can think of the people they want to model and ask themselves what they would do.

That is, "What would Hamza do?"

Do what they'd do.

As an athlete: what would Michael Jordan do?

## Video 4: Don't Fry Your Dopamine Receptors:

If you get too much dopamine from one source, then there's less incentive to get it from elsewhere. Especially if you're getting it with little effort.

Cheap dopamine lowers your dopamine baseline, making your normal existence shittier.

So, only effortful dopamine sources will lead to childlike happiness all the time.

We can use the brainpoints concept here as well:

If you spend your dopamine points, you have less for elsewhere.

Refuse to sacrifice your dopamine points for bullshit. Save them for your dreams.

## Video 5: 10k A Month Is Not A Lot Of Money

$10K is not a lot. Believe you can get there. What amount seems too much? That will be your glass ceiling.

If Hamza can, someone who started addicted to weed, you can as well.

## Video 6: Likes Ain't Cash

Money > fame. Fame constricts freedom in most ways. Money does the opposite.

Likes are not valuable. A core audience that loves you is.

You gotta amass an audience, and then make a product to sell to your audience.

The best metric to judge an audience is goodwill. The value you provided in excess of charge.

Your monthly income is a better metric than likes, but the number of people that think they owe you is an even greater metric.

## Video 7: Penetrate Your Fears
You will stay stagnant because you lie to yourself that this is as far as you can go. You are not living up to your potential because of fear.

What are you afraid of?

I am afraid of people who know me shitting on me for selling out or for overcharging (currency difference). But I have to remind myself that they are not the target audience and that they don't really give a shit.

## Video 8: Lifelong Student

This is something I have done well; it is almost my superpower. I outlearn everyone. The more I learn, the more I earn. If I know how to do something better than you, I will defeat you. The more I know, the better I get. Watching YouTube from an early age helped me with this.

I will learn forever. I will go to shift placements and learn everything I can.

Top-tier employees learn more and get better. Most employees learn for the first month and then work on autopilot. The best employees ask and learn constantly.

More volume, more feedback, better skill. Volume x Skill x Time wins.

## Video 9: Money Is The Score, Business The Game

Play the game you want to play. Do not rig the game or make it shitty/unpleasant to get a higher score.

Play the game you like. The highest score without messing with the experience. Hacking a video game takes all the fun out of it, and so does it with business. Money is a progress indicator, not the absolute.

Become addicted to the game of business.

The chase of the mission, the work preceding the outcome is the fulfillment. It is even better than achieving the goal.

Set that big goal and chase it, and then it becomes fun. Survival is not fun, progression is.

## Video 10: Invest in yourself

Put your money and time back into yourself. Your returns will compound and skyrocket.

Before a million in the bank, put your money back into education.

Put money into the stocks of yourself. Bet on yourself.

The stocks and shares of Ilyaas Kapadia.

Investing protects your money from inflation.

You keep your money with investment and make money with business.

Invest in your company, your success. Will you bet on someone else's success rather than your own? What kind of man is that?

Every course you buy is one module of your entrepreneurship degree. Each course will not produce a return, but overall the return will be greater than 10% a year, no question.

It is unsexy. Buy $500 worth of books. Read them over a year. Implement them and 10x your income.

Hamza's promise: up until you have $100K in your bank account, you shut the fuck up and keep investing in yourself.
