# The Rudest Book Every by Shwetabh Gangwar

You are a nation - foreign policy should be to not hand over authority to other people/nations

People are weird - they are phenomenons

Judge based on data, not feelings, impressions or narratives.

Be rational

Learn to think for yourself by solving your own problems - Hamza's idea of stare at your wall and think.

You don't know more than you know. Everyone is therefore stupid.

Admire people, don't follow them. They are humans, not heroes. Do not idealize people.
