This is in honor of Siddha. The only Mainland Mumbai bro who I ride with. The only mountain biker I know who comes close to being emotionally vulnerable with me. I value how you're the only MTBer I can convey gratitude to and receive it back, who does not get uncomfortable as soon as I convey emotions, who can handle my very emotional out there self. I value how you read consistently, and return my books in good condition. How you read mostly smut and I shit on you for it. I love how uncomfortable my sexuality makes you feel, and how you handle my flirts. It is a pleasure to flirt with you. Your discomfort is so absolutely entertaining. Here is to hoping both of us ride the Mumbai trail daily. It amazes me how fast you've gotten in what must be less than 6 months of riding. I hope you get into IIT and win nationals soon. I hope you figure out a way to visit Pashan as often as you want to. That was a dream of mine, and I would be so happy if you got to live that lifestyle.

Your next birthday will be celebrated without me. I look forward to the speed that one more year of riding would bring.

Happy birthday, brother.

Bohot Pyaar,
Ilyaas

1st Nov 2022:

Met Siddha at 7. and eyed his new car,. The only difference I saw was black seats, but that only goes to show my ignorance when it comes to cars.

We climbed up the trail only for Siddha to tell me that it was his birthday, and he came on a weekday, which is a change in routine for him, for a birthday ride. Makes sense.

We ride the Flow Trail and Temple Trail after a long time, stopping consistently mid-trail to clear rocks. Once, I stopped to remove a rock, and black ants laid claim to my legs. That was scary, and getting them off was time-consuming.

They've put a bunch of branches at the start of the ending, a stretch where, when pumped properly will result in speeds of 60kmph, and temporary, but extreme euphoria. Siddha was hesitant to ride this segment due to the sheer number of obstacles they put up to prevent from entering. I convinced him otherwise and it paid off. I swear, by 2025 this trail will have vanished if we extend the current rate of construction. However, I doubt that would happen. That way of thinking is a fallacy. Unfortunately, the Uttan trail is basically not a trail anymore, the owners decided to turn it into a kaccha road.

I climbed much faster than Siddha, and shit my pants in the middle when I thought I saw police on the trail. Upon pumping our tires for the temple trail we realized I run my tires at 10 psi. I like it that way. Magic Mary is too strong for more air. Regardless, I pumped it up to 20 psi, and off we went. Did I say we? I meant Siddha. I think it was my extra stiff suspension and air in my tires slowing me down but fuck, this asshole was wildin'. I had to get off-line to let him pass and pass he did. Fast as fuck. The last time he rode this trail, he had to walk most of it. I will adjust my suspension and be back for it bitch.

I started the day only for Siddha to tell me that it was his birthday. I checked my phone in the evening only for Siddha to tell me that it had been the best birthday of his life.

I fucked up the rest of the day. I procrastinated on schoolwork, which I had not touched for a week at that point, for like 3 hours, and then I did it. Major L. I learn from it though. Aaj, I attacked schoolwork. Half of it I've done. It is 12:30 and I've finished 75% percent of the work to be done today, after riding DH in the morning. Love the new routine. Love how Deep Work frees up so much of my time so I can do things I like, riding in the mornings and writing this for example. This routine is resulting in a re-calibration of my expectations of what can be achieved in a day and I am all for it.

I don't want school to re-open, not because I'll have to do work, but because getting ready for school and commuting is such a waste of time. Fortunately, the 12th syllabus will be completed in 2 weeks max, and then I can just not go except to ask for doubts. I have a nice setup at home as well, where I can study peacefully and mostly not be disturbed.
