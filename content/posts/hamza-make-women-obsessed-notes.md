Imagine you're in bed with multiple girls before responding to a girl if she is being weirdly disrespectful - when replying to Roof's text.

Mystery - do you want this? - he says I shouldn't do exactly what I'm striving for. Try this - ties in with the previous point

"What have you done today"
"Lots."

when she is obsessed with you, she is thinking a lot about you.

Make her feel all the emotions possible - low to high - this ties in to Jordan Peterson's be a monster - and a certain number of negative emotions to positive emotions - not bliss, but someone to contend with. Not in a manipulative way - make her feel like shit, but in candor - the truth without sugar coating it - lay it bare even if it is hurful.

cry, scared, excited, happy, disgust, angry

Don't stay in the middle. Don't stay safe - don't be boring. Take her through all of it - Roof and how enzo has "stefan's goodness and damon's recklessness too" - full spectrum of emotions.

Scare her. It is okay. Feel free to hurt her, to dissapoint her. practice it, go through the bell curve.

Spike her emotions. She wants to feel - it is her feminine energy inside of her

Be masculine - and make her be femenine. BE masculine.

Be disciplined - don't be swayed by your emotions. For me, showcase your masculine. I am very femenine when I am with my tribe.

Don't spend all the time with her - play and sex. One hour of presence is better than tolerating 3 - and resenting her later for it.

Work for 2-3 hours. Then go kiss her, make out, play fight with her - the top-up of masculine energy she needs.
