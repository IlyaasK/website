I want to produce now, and consume only the best content available - books and some OGs I like but that is it. I want my screen time to be limited to production and video calls with friends as most of them live outside my country. Video calls are a boon. I'm grateful for their existence.

This blog is production. A lot of it, except for book notes or video notes, are produced in standard notes on my phone. I write this as I shit. Literally. Content matters not production quality. This ties in well with the concept of [web authenticity](https://manuelmoreale.com/online-authenticity)

I have 8 unfiltered videos I am waiting to post when my circumstances change 6 to 9 months from now. That's production. Waiting for my exams to get over, so I can edit the MTB content - production.

Post on insta about riding - production.

Read and produce.
