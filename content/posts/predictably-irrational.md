#Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely

Don't fall for the decoy effect.

Don't fall for the anchoring effect - ifyou do, anchor yoursekf un a way that rationally benefits you.

Dn't fall for the self-herding or arbitrary coherence effect - think each decision through. Don't substitute a difficlt problem for an easy one.

Use your appearance and body language to anchor your social value
