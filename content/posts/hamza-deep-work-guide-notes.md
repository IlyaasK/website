Piece of paper:

Purpose (present tense)

I am….

Alpha goals - identity - frame:
Beta goals - 2022 - motivational - should excite:
Lead measures - weeky -habits - produce/hrs of deep work:

Dont use your phone till you finish your deep work session - 90 mins - data collect to optimise routine. Use parkinson’s time

10  mins

Next block

Then check phone

Deep work right after waking up

Or newest hamza routine is 3x a day but 3 session with like an hour to 3 of shallow work in the middle

Shutdown ritual - for life, night routine.

Make sure plan next day is part of it

For me, getting home/out of library

Publish this

Environment:

Disable notifications
Do not disturb/airplane
On PC as well

Idea; Pure morning - like a prison until work is done - no distractions. Qrc lodge will be distractions 100

Remove/reduce obligations - atleast post deep work

Scoreboard of accountability - hrs of deepwork - send to discord server - your server - use instagram like this. 0 followers - Try this.

Use rewards: no don’t do this - intrinsic motivation and routine.

Mindset:

Time - hace a scarcity mindset

Do only deepwork - today the whole day as shallow work

New - shallow work = instant gratification

More shallow work, more tired, less rest, shittier deep work the next day.

Be okay with shit things happening because you don’t do shallow work anymore - friends now angry - turn to signal.

Outsource shallow work - multi-task with shallow work - batching - do with whatsapp?

Grand gesture - do something so big you will work - hire work, hire a person, massive commitment - this would be like buying a bike park/great bike/nutritionist/coach but I don’t need this with MTB.

Roughly capped at 4 hours a day. May be extended a little bit if deep work is for different activities.

This is a skill.

Positive reinforcement - more hours, better skill, praise yourself

Shallow work budget - do this for instant gratification as well.

Also hard stop at work time - not any benefit mindset - 5pm for example.
