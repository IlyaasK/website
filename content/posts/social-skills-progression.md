I told a friend that I got accepted into college and would be leaving soon. She teared up. I did not think we were close enough to warrant that reaction. It was a pleasant surprise.
It is surprising how much actually listening matters to people.

It is testament to how much better I've become social skills wise.

6 months, several books and way too many youtube videos later, I have become good enough to make close friends over time.

And there is SO MUCH space to improve. Looking at someone like Hamza and [his relationship with his significant other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a9MnnJtu3g) is so inspiring. That is where one can reach, provided he creates enough value.

I would like to end this one in classic Hamza fashion, as a salute to him.

Do the hard work, especially when you don't feel like it.

Edit:

I spoke to her and I realized it was mainly listening. It surprises me how if you can learn to listen and actually listen - ask questions and empathize with the other person, give sound advice when asked for it, how rare that is. And how much of a relationship you develop based on listening.

BRO, she now draws boundaries. My advice helped. I HAVE POSITIVELY INFLUENCED A LIFE, and in the long run. I helped cultivate a skill she will use for the rest of her life. I helped her learn to fish. Now she will be fishing for the rest of her life, ceteris paribus, which I know is a risky assumption to make.

Regardless, that excites me greatly. I am useful to others now. I am so happy, proud even, that I am.

The goal is to become a connector and deliver insane value. [Hamza spoke about this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcAxJJs10Uc)
