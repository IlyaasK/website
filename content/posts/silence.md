Seriously. It's great.

This is my second time writing on the shitter. Silence works wonders. No social media. Only books and writing. Silence spurred production for me.

I am also less tired at the end of my work day. Less processing, less tired. Less processing, more important shit rises to the surface for you to process. Ties in with [Naval Ravikant's medition practice](https://piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=R2kgZ1Puye8).

Shit with a notebook. Eat with a book. Journal everyday.

Goes for music as well. Stop the BS music. In Mumbai, the traffic is prolific. I put on my earphones so I can block some of the noise. Allows me to think or relax better. Silence is one of those forgotten things we don't have in modern life anymore, so the re-introduction of it feels signicant in terms of quality-of-life improvement.

Even for me to work deeply. I work so much faster in silence. Evolutionarily we are designed to function with a LOT of downtime.
