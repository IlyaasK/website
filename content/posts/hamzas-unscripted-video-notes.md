Achieve exploding income:

Control - not YT. Need total control. - Odysee/streaming platform
Entry - great barriers to entry - mid level for YT  great for pro MTB
Is there a need for this?- for SI, yes. For MTB DOc, over time, as I get better people want to know how,
Product should be great.
Scale - you should be able to have 200K customers, for example

money should be decoupled from time

Kinetic action - The grind
Action>answers - just work, get your product out. Short feedback loop - the lean startup

Act - grab your phone and record 50 videos
Access - see if demand exists - for YT, views
Adjust - make more videos on what gets hits

Remember, this is to optimize money, not morality

No balance - obsession. Extreme. 3 years, one thing, it will be achieved. - for me, YT and MTB.
Balance is a lie.

Be immune to comparisons - eliminate them. Compete with people running the same race. Dopamine detox. Practice, like a meditation practice.
Purposed saving - emergency fund, save for tax
Limit lifestyle inflation - conscious
20 percent mine
80 percent reinvest
Consequential thought - risk management - second order consequences by sam ovens

## What would you do if you won billions of dollars?

 - Retire Family
 - Retire SO
 - Sick tech setup
 - Buy luxuries - things that would enhance my life not detract from it
 - outsource all things - food, clean, all maintenance etc
 - outsource all things I don't like
 - Ride a lot of MTB
 - Blog and YT - documenting MTB and SI
 - Spend a lot of time reading and sleeping.
 - a lot of Linux
 - I would race professionally, since money is no object I can hire editors, video person, mechanic, etc.
 - I may start experimenting - how a bodybuilder type frame impacts MTB - use occam's protocol
 - Travel? probably not - a lot of MTB travel most likely
 - Squeeze out of myself - coach, psychologist, sleep coach, etc.
 - Sleep at 7 and wake up at 5 - or something like that
 - not go to school

 - climb mount Everest
 - learn salsa insane and guitar instrument insane - but this would be post MTB.
 - Things I imagine would be fun to do but not important
 - Minimize efficiency with SO - insane dates
 - Fatherhood would be massive when I have kids - full time job to raise Adonis.
