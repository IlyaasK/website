How Alex Hormozi grew a 1.2M following:

1. Use twitter as brain dump - try this.
2. Create YT from the best performing tweets.
3. Add call to action - if you liked this, share to a friend. Record 30 and sprinke them throughout your content
4. Contextualise to the platform you're shipping on
5. Increase volume

10x in content is not 10x followers, it is 10x followers. Volume.

More output, more results - upload to blog everyday. Upload to youtube everyday.

talk about shit you have done. You have to answer "why should I listen to you?"

have the authority by doing the shit you talk about - become GOAT first and then tel people how to do it. Don't become Hamza - share your journey - change the way your speak.

"I don't know. This is what worked for me this time. I hope it serves you."

I stand here truthfully unafraid. Not because of the path that lies before me, but because of the path that lies behind me.

Give away the secrets, and sell the implementation. Coaching, for example - personal attention is the value add

What if I give away all my shit and everyone now knows it. flipside: What you put out shit and everyone consumes it. Which one do you think will make you more money?

Persuasive power - reciprocity. Get them drunk on the value you provide and they provide value back.

Privde magnitudes more value than you're charging - that is how you create a raving customer.

Make your free stuff better than their pad stuff - put out skillshare course on youtube - Hamza did this

leverage is the ratio between inputs to outputs in a system. It costs you the same whether 1 person watches the video or 1 million. But you are one. You will recieve all the goodwill from them. This is how you amass significant wealth.

Make more money - higher multiplier effect on your time and other resource.

Master time to master money.

Default time period to get something dine - 1 week
 new default - 1 day. extrapolate this speed to a decade and you're wealthy.

 This is efficiency.

 macro aspect: effectiveness - are these activities in alignment with my goals

Do they compound over a decade? Are they directionally aligned, over decades?

"most people's plans, when you add time, get worse" - speak to Roof and Arya bout this

wealthy people talk in decades, not days

It is unreasonable that id I did this for 10 years, I wouldn't be significantly wealthier than now - YT and MTB

The ultra successful:
1. Have a superiority complex - think they are better than others
2. Massive inscurity and fear of failure
3. Impulse control - focus

live delayed gratification - live on 30k for the next 5 years. Then a million a year. Learn skills tabhi.

sacrifices are trade-offs - they are prices you must pay if you want to get there.

what is the price-tag of your dreams?

for sales, spend more time on the problems of your customer than understanding the product.

watch video: [I was once weak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcD2t9qt-fM&t=148s)

The point of the sale is to decide. Polarization - ties in to pick up.

 on a scale of a one to a 10. where are you? X. what would it take me to get you to a 10? Then do that. Why are you not a 1? Then they sell you on it

if X weren't the issue would you say yes? What would it look like to not have X?
