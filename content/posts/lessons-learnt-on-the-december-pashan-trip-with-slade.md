Brake before berms not in them.
Get your brakes sorted. Already in the pipeline.
Section bits of trail to get faster.
Ride with intention of mastering particular things - brake free/learn sharkfin/berms, etc.
Sleep more. Make MTB effecient. No point in waking up at 7 and starting riding at 11:30. Wake up at 10 instead. Or ride early.
Get your phone serviced when you have water damage. Power it down asap. Only Rs.300 for servicing.
Use Xirify Shopping app to get 10% off, and rs.50 off on first 3 orders at Durga.

[Slade](instagram.com/sladegomes21/) dropped wisdom: He intentionally withheld from dating despite many offers until he found someone he knew he could be with permanently. His criteria for that was adventure-loving. He knew over time most would ask him to sacrifice his speed addiction. So he waited for one that wouldn't. Shreya rides. Thus ties with Naval's [if you wouldn't be with them for a lifetime, don't be with them for a day](https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/play-long-term-games-with-long-term-people). He also withheld - made it easy. No little dabbling. He formed an identity/firm boundaries that made it easier for him. Her brother also chased him with the intention of physical assault when he found out about them. He played the brain game, the long game instead. Choosing get financially and location-wise sorted before initiating marriage.

Fuck comfort braking - slowly get rid of it. Choose braking points and then don't brake except them. Braking causes you to lose traction - Berm line.

[Pashan](instagram.com/pashan_trailpark/) has a temporary USP of great trails. This will not be the case in 6 months when Pimplas is much more developed. Then the USP will be Viru, Abhi, Kapil, Pranay - the bois essentially, the community. Have to find a way to get them to Kalyan or build a community in Kalyan.

[Virendra](instagram.com/virendra_mali/) built [2 berms in 30 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6WpjBznU4c). Effeciency. Learn.

Slade tip: clear out the whole trail then start building.

also, to lure people in to build: you get to build your own line. Anything goes. We all will help you. we will not say anything.

slade had to wake up at 4 to build and sleep at 9. learn. 13 consecutive days of building and one day of riding.

Slade also told me I should stop sessioning when I am not making progress, as I will reinforce mistakes. He recommended I take a break and do other trails and come back to the step-up.
