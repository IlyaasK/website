I live the dream.

To race world cups professionally.

Specicfaccly, I'm in Queenstown at QRC. I am here becasue access to world class lift-assissted trails.

I am here to learn to float over rocks and rail berms.
I am here to become speed incarnate.
I am here to sacrifice it all for my 8 year old self.
I am here to sacrifice it all my 80 year old self.

I am here to become the wind, to become the ghost.

I am here to win, to get sponsored and then to win internationally.

I think I can do it.

With pros praciticing here, and constantly being able to chase someone faster than me, I can do it.

I can outlearn these people. I was born in adversity. Pain is an old friend.

I will give it my all because the alternative is not worth living.

I am here to springboard into the world cup circiut.

I know, that when the race results come, the sponsors will as well.

I am here to become a professional downhill mountain biker.

I will do this by riding more, listening to Piyush to on the bike technique, training at the gym in the winter.

I will document it on YouTube or here or twitter for short form, my progress.
