Behind The Brand Alex Hormozi Podcast

You only get one name. Act accordingly.

I can die to myself or die to my father. - I can die to myself or die to the masses.

Memento Mori - use when making big decisions - reorients to a selfish thing - removes society from the decision.

You are going to die. There is no legacy. Everyone will forget you within 10 generations guaranteed. Agreed. Legacy for me is within my lifetime - the people coming to me and thanking me for the positive influence hamza type.

Whatever I will do is easier than what your father did. I speak English. I stand on his shoulders.

In our 20s we care about what others think about us. In our 40s we start to not care about what others think about us. In our 60s we realize no one was thinking about us, to begin with.

What are the things I hate? Change those things.
What are the things I love - probably the inverse of the things you hate. Try those.

He happens to love business more than fitness.

Choose the right market - it should be scalable.

Kept finding father figures. Chose to go without partners to learn not to find father figures in his partners.

When going into a partnership, lay out the terms. Everything explicit.

One thing. Focus.

Leverage - low Marginal Cost - code and media best opportunities.

If partnering - different and complementary skills and the same strong values

Learning comes in retrospect - reverse engineering like learning accounts from the mark scheme.

A relationship should be given *and* take - you must give AND you must take - 8/10 giver.

give vs donate? is it giving or donating when expecting reciprocity?

Give, give, give, get - or ask, not take.

8/10 giver is when you know what you're willing to give and not willing to give and then do not budge.

Test/frame to choose people in your life:

Will this guy give his life for me?
Do I trust this guy with my wife for a long time?
Can I give him a huge sum of money and be back later and not have it vanish?
Will this guy let me in his house to hide during the holocaust?

Use this frame. Assume hardship, Assume war.

If we both don't agree, we don't do it. Unanimous agreement.

Complete trust- joint bank accounts, give her TOTP and Bitwarden pass - Ilyaas - extend trust and people step up.

 They are more extremely themselves because the other person exists - polarity.

 Competitive advantage - have more information. You know how to do it. Information arbitrage - buyer and seller.

 opportunity - how many can I sell? how much profit - margin. How many good players - lower is better. You want all 3 in a business opportunity.

 Opportunity is basically leverage.

 What do my top 20% of customers have in common? Now sell to only those people.

 acquisition.com - $400K
 marketing.com $5.6M
 the fastest road to financial freedom - know thyself - for MTB and going pro in addition to documenting - YT and blog. 2. Skills - develop them, by doing.

 Warren has 150B in cash. So Alex is loaded as well. Maa and I also have mostly cash. Let's see where this goes.

Where does the opportunity exist? Look at the businesses that have survived the longest - they survived because they make tons of money - JP Morgan for example.

Make the most money:  Exon - oil. Facebook - eyeballs cost basically nothing.

To guaranteed become a millionaire in a decade, you have to be willing to resist becoming a millionaire in 90 days. Resist the woman in the red dress.

Learn to sell.

Work to learn or earn. in the beginning, work to learn.

Brand = reputation. Reputation is what people say when you are not around.

Unimpeachable character, sincere candor, and competitive greatness.

bro's goal is to get his girl onto the Forbes 100 self-made richest women.
because it would be cool. Be like Alex.

wanting something is reason enough.

Branding is higher ROI in the long run, compared to paid ads, so be patient and keep uploading.
