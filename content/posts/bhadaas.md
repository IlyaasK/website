I finished 3/6 tasks today. There is a certain frustration that comes with saying in my room the whole day that I've discovered.

There is a certain frustration that comes with being interrupted.

There is a certain frustration that comes with not riding.

There is a certain frustration that comes with doing boring/shallow work like sorting files.

There is a certain frustration that comes with having to do chores.

There is a certain frustration that comes with staying in school, studying, knowing it will not make me a faster mountain biker.

There is a certain frustration that comes with the footie lacking story, with telling bad stories.

There is a certain frustration that comes with a lack of action.

All of these seem like mindset problems.

I feel like I have pent up bhadaas, and therefore, I am writing.

Back to tasks.
