# The Magic Of Thinking Big by David Schwartz

By David Schwartz

"Why be only half alive?"

Clasp hand. "I'm glad to know you."

Wear you best clothes - spend twice as much and buy half as much.

Introduce yourself to everyone. Smile. Stand up straight.

Think progressively - eat more good mind food (mind food is media consumption)

Ask yourself "what can I do to improve?" Answers will come to you.

Take interest in the other person. Listen. Put yourself in their shoes and then make a decision as a leader.

You will reach where you aim.

Think I can and you will - excuses are only a mind game.

Action cures fear - do.

"underneath he is probably a very nice guy. Most people are."

You can placebo yourself into feeling better. Do it.

"Big people monopolize listening." Listen.

To get ideas, stimulate your brain - books and people are stimulation.

"Am I worthy of being imitated in every way?"

Manipulate your environment for success.

Seek advice from the right people, people who have achieved what you want to do.

Do not fucking gossip.

Grow the service-first attitude. Provide excellence and money will follow.

Remember names. Don't judge. Be humble and equanimous. Praise everytime you can. Show genuine interest

Learn from your failures. Better your systems.

Set goals and form a plan, then follow it. To the T.

Handle thigs the human, the kind way.

Spend time in solitude, to think. You can meditate, you can use a pen and paper.
