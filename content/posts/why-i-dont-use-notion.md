I use [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com/).

1. It is an open-source application.
2. It offers encrypted backups.
3. It stores our notes in an encrypted format.
4. It also syncs between different devices and platforms.
5. It has a search bar.

That is all I need. I have found notion has an upfront time investment that I'm not willing to make. Plus just searching shit just works. Keyboard>mouse. Much simpler, works offline, and the app does not take as much time to load as Notion. All I need.
